title: "Diving into jet substructure"
teaching: 30
exercises: 90
questions:
- "What is jet substructure?"
- "What does the jet substructure look like for the signal?"
- "What are some commonly used jet substructure observables for t/W identification?"
- "How can jet substructure help combat background and differentiate it from signal?"
objectives:
- "Familiarisation with common jet substructure variables."
- "Produce plots of jet substructure variables in signal."
- "Identify possiblle selections for signal."
keypoints:
- "Jet substructure are analysis techniques leading to measuring an observable of a jet through its constituent information."
- "Tops decay to b+W. Tagging an all-hadronic top is looking for a 3-pronged jet with b-hadrons with a mass close to 173 GeV. W bosons are tagged as two pronged jets in a mass window around 80 GeV."
- "N-subjetiness is how 'N-pronged' a jet looks, more specifically for N subjets it is the sum of pt-weighted constuent-subjet spatial moments."
- "Traditional top-tagging typically uses tau_32 and jet mass, whereas for W-tagging it's tau_21 and the jet mass."
