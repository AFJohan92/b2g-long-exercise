title: "Optimising the analysis"
teaching: 10
exercises: 20
questions:
- "What aspects of our analysis do we want to optimize?"
- "How can we quantify selections to help decide SR/CR definitons."
- "Do some variables affect signal and BG differently/similarly?"
- "Are there any correlated varibles?"
- "What final selections are going to be applied to the analysis"
objectives:
- "Identify optimizable parts of analysis."
- "Use Punzi significance and other measures to optimise selections."
- "Obtain a close-to-optimal selection to define SR."
keypoints:
- "Preselection is not enough to be sensitive to signal, we need to tighten selection to increase significance of signal to background."
- "The traditional way of optimizing selections is to apply N-1 (all-but one) cuts and findng peak of significance curve in removed cut."
- "Boosted Decision Trees and other multivariate optimization techniques are also widely used."
