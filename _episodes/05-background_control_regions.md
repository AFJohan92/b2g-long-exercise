title: "Controlling the background"
teaching: 15
exercises: 45
questions:
- "What is the background to the search?"
- "How can we model the background processes affecting our measurement?"
- "Do we have common resources to estimate the background?"
- "How can we test our background modeling technique?"
- "How and why should we enrich a particular background process when defining control regions?"
objectives:
- "Identify background processes affecting current preselection."
- "Understand performance and limitations of background simulations."
- "Develop control regions in which one can estimate individual backgroud processes."
- "Understand the concept of blinding, and have a first look into data in CRs."
keypoints:
- "The backgrounds involved are processes producing jets with large pT that look like t+W."
- "All-hadronic ttbar can look like t+W if one of tops has a very soft (or untagged) b-jet."
- "Z+Jets, where Z decays hadronically, can seem like t+W since Z mass is probably within W-window selection and the jets can combinatorically yield a high (top-like) mass."
- "LHC is a hadron collider, multi-jet production (QCD) is almost always a background in all hadronic analyses."
- "Blinding is the convention of not looking at data in the SR (or any signal-enriched selection)."
- "Control regions are used to study specific backgrounds in a kinematic region orthogonal to the signal regions; we test our background estimation in CRs and apply corrections needed there to the SR."
- "Validation regions are designed to lie orthgonal but between CRs and SRs, perhaps with lower target BG purity, to test the corrections extracted from the CR that will be applied to SRs."
