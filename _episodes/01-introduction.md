title: "Introduction to All-Hadronic b*->tW and Useful Tools Like CI/CD"
teaching: 20
exercises: 40
questions:
- "Who are you?" 
- "What is this exercise about?"
- "Why search for heavy resonances?"
- "What is CI/CD?" 
objectives:
- "Familiarize ourselves with peers and resources."
- "Contexualize a CMS-style search and its stages"
- "Understand motivation for physics at high masses/scales."
- "Begin making new habits with good coding practices."
keypoints:
- "First level of help is within yourselves. Ask your teammate questions you are asking yourself."
- "Ask your facilitators for help if you feel stuck, the point of this exercise is to give you 'big picture' experiences not coding challenges."
- "We're preparing for Run 3 and HL-LHC, and exploring models that are motivating and not excluded by Run 2 observations."
- "Eliminate fear-of-losing-data by using version control! Commit often, and document, document, document. Save yourself time later by setting CI/CD tests."
