title: "Investigating the signal topology"
teaching: 15
exercises: 45
questions:
- "What is the signal we are trying to select for?"
- "What observables should be investigated for our final state?"
- "What do kinematics in the signal look like?"
- "How do observables change as a function of resonance mass?"
- "Is there an observable that directly probes the signal?"
objectives:
- "Familiarisation with the ntuple format."
- "Plot several kinematic variables at parton, particle, and reconstructed level. (Bonus: Investigate relative resolution)"
- "Reconstruct the invariant resonance mass."
keypoints:
- "In an all-hadronic state, we veto leptons (electrons/muons) and study jet properties."
- "Jets are clustered Particle Flow candidates interpreted as a 4-vector with momenta, energy, and mass."
- "The resonance searched decays to all particles in final state, thus if we add all jets in vector-form we can reconstruct the resonance."
