title: "Diving into jet substructure"
teaching: 20
exercises: 40
questions:
- "What is jet substructure?"
- "What does the jet substructure look like for the signal?"
- "What are some commonly used jet substructure observables for t/W identification?"
- "How can jet substructure help combat background and differentiate it from signal?"
objectives:
- "Familiarisation with common jet substructure variables."
- "Identify possiblle discriminating varibles for b*->tW signal."
keypoints:
- "Jet substructure are analysis techniques for measuring a jet observable through its constituent information."
- "N-subjetiness is how 'N-pronged' a jet looks, more specifically for N subjets it is the sum of pt-weighted constuent-subjet spatial moments."
- "Traditional top-tagging typically uses &tau;<sub>32</sub> and jet mass, whereas for W-tagging it's &tau;<sub>21<\sub> and the jet mass."
